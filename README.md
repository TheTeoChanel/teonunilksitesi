# OIIA site

Its just a site with rotating funny images of me.

# How to open

Open `index.html` with browser that you use.

# How to change images?

1. Add an image to folder `oiia-main/images`.
2. Open `index.html` file with any text or code editor, then find a
`div` with `class="spinning"` and there will be `img` element.

3. Change `src` paramater in `img` tag to image that you put in the `oiia-main/images`(example `image.png`).
3. Save `index.html` file and open it with browser that you use (or reset the page with `F5` key)
